"""
VITO - Discord -> Gemini bot (main.py)
Fast, accurate, per-user chats, with priority + stop logic.

Behavior:
- Only responds when mentioned: @VITO (or bot mention)
- Each Discord user gets their own Gemini chat (separate Playwright page).
- newchat: resets that user's Gemini page.
- stop: cancels all current/queued work, resets pages, BUT does NOT kill the bot.
- Priority:
    * 'yoruboku' has absolute priority.
      - When they ask, all current work is cancelled and their question runs first.
      - Nobody can stop their answer except themselves.
    * One extra OWNER_USERNAME (from .env) has elevated rights:
      - Cannot be stopped except by themselves or 'yoruboku'.
- Answers:
    * Bot mentions the asker at the start: "<@user>\n<gemini answer>"
    * Gemini answer is forwarded exactly (no extra links/edits).
